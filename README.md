## Overview

Create a new vue js application using the cli then setup a counter composable with increment, decrement, reset, setValue functions with a valid UI. You can use local state or vuex for state management albeit using vuex will attract higher marks. Make sure to house your functionality in a page with route - ‘/counter’ any other route should redirect the user to a 404 page handled by your wildcard route.
